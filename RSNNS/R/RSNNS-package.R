#' The Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNS) is a library containing many 
#' standard implementations of neural networks. This package wraps the SNNS 
#' functionality to make it available from within R.
#' 
#' If you have problems using RSNNS, find a bug, or have suggestions, please
#' do not write to the general R lists or contact the authors of the original 
#' SNNS software. Instead, you should: File an issue on github (bugs/suggestions),
#' Ask your question on Stackoverflow under the tag RSNNS, or write to the mailing list
#' (rsnns@@googlegroups.com). If all that fails, then you can also contact the maintainer 
#' directly by email. 
#' 
#' If you use the package, please cite the following work in your publications:
#'
#' Bergmeir, C. and Benítez, J.M. (2012), Neural Networks in R Using the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator: RSNNS. Journal of Statistical Software, 46(7), 1-26. \url{http://www.jstatsoft.org/v46/i07/}
#'
#' The package has a hierarchical architecture with three levels:
#' \itemize{
#' \item RSNNS high-level api (rsnns)
#' \item RSNNS low-level api (SnnsR)
#' \item The api of our C++ port of SNNS (SnnsCLib)
#' }
#' 
#' Many demos for using both low-level and high-level api of the package are
#' available. To get a list of them, type:
#' 
#' \code{library(RSNNS)}
#' 
#' \code{demo()}
#'  
#' It is a good idea to start with the demos of the high-level api (which is
#' much more convenient to use). E.g., to access the iris classification demo
#' type:
#' 
#' \code{demo(iris)}
#'  
#' or for the laser regression demo type:
#' 
#' \code{demo(laser)} 
#' 
#' As the high-level api is already quite powerful and flexible, you'll most
#' probably normally end up using one of the functions: \code{\link{mlp}},
#' \code{\link{dlvq}}, \code{\link{rbf}}, \code{\link{rbfDDA}},
#' \code{\link{elman}},  \code{\link{jordan}}, \code{\link{som}},
#' \code{\link{art1}}, \code{\link{art2}}, \code{\link{artmap}}, or
#' \code{\link{assoz}}, with some pre- and postprocessing. These S3 classes are
#' all subclasses of \code{\link{rsnns}}.
#' 
#' You might also want to have a look at the original SNNS program and the SNNS
#' User Manual 4.2, especially pp 67-87 for explications on all the parameters
#' of the learning functions, and pp 145-215 for detailed (theoretical)
#' explications of the methods and advice on their use. And, there is also the 
#' javaNNS, the sucessor of SNNS from the original authors. It makes the C core 
#' functionality available from a Java GUI.
#' 
#' Demos ending with "SnnsR" show the use of the low-level api. If you want to
#' do special things with neural networks that are currently not implemented in
#' the high-level api, you can see in this demos how to do it. Many demos are
#' present both as high-level and low-level versions.
#' 
#' The low-level api consists mainly of the class \code{\link{SnnsR-class}},
#' which internally holds a pointer to a C++ object of the class
#' \code{SnnsCLib}, i.e., an instance of the SNNS kernel. The class furthermore
#' implements a calling mechanism for methods of the \code{SnnsCLib} object, so
#' that they can be called conveniently using the "$"-operator. This calling
#' mechanism also allows for transparent masking of methods or extending the
#' kernel with new methods from within R. See
#' \code{\link{$,SnnsR-method}}. R-functions that are added by RSNNS to the
#' kernel are documented in this manual under topics beginning with
#' \code{SnnsRObject$}. Documentation of the original SNNS kernel user interface
#' functions can be found in the SNNS User Manual 4.2 pp 290-314.  A call to,
#' e.g., the SNNS kernel function \code{krui_getNoOfUnits(...)} can be done with
#' \code{SnnsRObject$getNoOfUnits(...)}. However, a few functions were excluded
#' from the wrapping for various reasons. Fur more details and other known
#' issues see the file /inst/doc/KnownIssues.
#' 
#' Another nice tool is the \code{NeuralNetTools} package, that can be used to
#' visualize and analyse the networks generated with RSNNS.
#' 
#' Most of the example data included in SNNS is also present in this package, see \code{\link{snnsData}}.
