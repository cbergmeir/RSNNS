Description: The Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNS) is a library
    containing many standard implementations of neural networks. This
    package wraps the SNNS functionality to make it available from
    within R. Using the 'RSNNS' low-level interface, all of the
    algorithmic functionality and flexibility of SNNS can be accessed.
    Furthermore, the package contains a convenient high-level
    interface, so that the most common neural network topologies and
    learning algorithms integrate seamlessly into R.
